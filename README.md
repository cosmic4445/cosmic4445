Hi, I'm Cuber. I'm a game developer that creates VR games and custom scripts for people. I suspect that I have ADHD somehow but I feel like I don't.

<br/><br/>

**Currently**
- Learning HTML, CSS, JS
- Creating "Super Soldiers" as a Unity game

<br/><br/>

I have a very good interest in coding and game development from making website games, to Unity engine development. I like sharing my work with other people and showing people how to make their first game. I keep trying to encourage myself to make YouTube content but I also don't want to go through that process of editing videos.

<br/><br/>

**Tools I Use**

I like to create dumb stuff for no reason whatsoever and be proud of my work. I don't care about what other people think what I did wrong or what I should do. When people get mad at me I get the "go f yourself" or "go kill yourself" but I never listen to them.
